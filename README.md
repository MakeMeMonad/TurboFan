## Who ~~Built~~ Is Building TurboFan?


## What is TurboFan?
TurboFan is an in-development plugin for the JetBrains IDE ecosystem, aiming to bring modern, full-featured support for the Swift language and toolchain to JetBrains editors—especially CLion. Inspired by the legacy of AppCode and the growing, cross-platform Swift community, TurboFan’s goal is to make Swift development accessible, customizable, and fun on any platform, for any developer.

## Why Turbofan? (Motivations)
I started TurboFan after a long search for an accessible, extensible, and genuinely usable Swift IDE outside of Xcode. As a disabled indie developer, I hit wall after wall: Xcode’s accessibility limitations, the shutdown of AppCode, closed-source plugins, and projects with little interest in outside contributions. Most available tools either lacked basic features, didn’t support community collaboration, or simply weren’t open.

After trying everything from VSCode to CLion, only JetBrains’ IDEs struck the right balance—if only there was proper Swift support! With AppCode discontinued and other efforts closed to contributors, I decided to try building my own.

It’s been a massive learning experience—crash-coursing everything from JVM internals and JetBrains plugin APIs, to BNF grammars and tokenizers—just to get one of my favorite languages working in my favorite IDE. But it’s also been rewarding, and I’m eager to share what I’ve learned and, hopefully, build a community around it.

## Why Open Source?
The existing options for Swift outside Xcode are limited and often not truly open. I believe that the best tools come from passionate communities, not gatekeeping. TurboFan is open-source because I want to welcome anyone who’s excited by this idea: whether you want to contribute code, share feedback, ask questions, or just watch the project grow.

## Current State
TurboFan is still in early development, but you can try it out, hack on it, or just follow along. See Installation below for details. Basic parsing/tokenizing work is underway, and the foundation for deeper IDE integration is being built out.

## Resources
Want to help? Or just curious? Feel free to open issues, make suggestions, or drop by and say hi. I love talking about accessibility, language design, JetBrains APIs, Swift, F#, and all kinds of nerdy topics—don’t be shy!
